# WIP
## Unnamed game

This repository handles API for a single game instance.

## How to run repository locally

This repo uses FastAPI python library as a base, so you will need to install python and FastAPI to use it
(`pip install fastapi`). After you have both python and FastAPI set up, you can start the backend localy 
using `fastapi dev main.py` from the root directory.

To list API endpoints 
All endpoints are currently dummy, but you can use `/hello` to test if everything runs properly.

### Testing

Pytest is used for testing purposes, to run all tests, run `pytest` from root directory.
